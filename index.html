              <h3>No Poverty</h3>
              <p>
                Eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030 is
                a pivotal goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
                Extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per
                person per day at 2017 purchasing power parity, has witnessed
                remarkable declines over recent decades.

              <h3>Clean Water and Sanitation</h3>
              <p>
                Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is the most basic
                human need for health and well-being. Billions of people will
                lack access to these basic services in 2030 unless progress
                quadruples. Demand for water is rising owing to rapid population
                growth, urbanization and increasing water needs from
                agriculture, industry, and energy sectors.

              <p>
                Great strides have been made in improving peopleâ€™s health in
                recent years. 146 out of 200 countries or areas have already met
                or are on track to meet the SDG target on under-5 mortality.
                Effective HIV treatment has cut global AIDS-related deaths by 52
                per cent since 2010 and at least one neglected tropical disease
                has been eliminated in 47 countries.
